# Typical Scenarios Where Face Check Applies

This page highlights common scenarios where Microsoft Entra Verified ID with Face Check delivers the highest security value by increasing assurance that the right person is present at the moment of a sensitive action. These scenarios are intentionally practical—they reflect real‑world identity risks that organisations routinely face, where traditional authentication alone (passwords, MFA) may not provide sufficient protection against impersonation, social engineering, or synthetic identity attacks.


For organisations evaluating Verified ID, these scenarios are designed to serve as a starting point. They can be used to assess where higher assurance verification would meaningfully reduce risk in your own environment, help prioritise initial use cases, and guide early pilots or proofs of concept. Each scenario should be interpreted through your organisation’s specific context—including risk appetite, user personas, regulatory obligations, operational maturity, and existing identity controls—and adapted accordingly rather than implemented verbatim.

| Scenario | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| High‑risk user onboarding | Prove a new user is the legitimate identity holder |
| Privileged access elevation | Confirm operator presence before sensitive actions |
| Account recovery | Prevent social‑engineering‑based account resets |
| Remote workforce verification | Validate identity without physical presence |
| Regulated access events | Meet assurance requirements for compliance‑bound systems |
| Step‑up verification for anomalies | Dynamically respond to risky sign‑in activity |
