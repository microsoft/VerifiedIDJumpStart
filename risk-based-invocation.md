# Scenario 6: Real‑Time / Risk‑Based Verification

## Goal
Dynamically increase identity assurance when risk signals are detected.

## Functional Steps to Test
1. A user attempts a sensitive action.
2. Risk signals indicate elevated risk.
3. Additional identity verification is required.
4. The user presents their Verified ID.
5. Face Check confirms live presence.
6. Successful verification allows continuation.
7. Failed verification blocks the action and escalates.

## Expected Outcomes
- Additional assurance is applied only when needed.
- User experience remains consistent.
- High‑risk attempts are strongly verified.
